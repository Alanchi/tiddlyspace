TiddlySpace is a new [[open source service|Open Source Service]] that lets you publish and share your thoughts. It is being developed by a community of independent developers, supported by Osmosoft, BT's open source innovation unit. It is still in the early stages of development and so should be used in a spirit of experimentation. It works best with the latest versions of Safari, Chrome and Firefox.
